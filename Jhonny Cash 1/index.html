				<h2 id="title">Men in Black</h2>	
				<p id= "lyrics">Well, you wonder why I always dress in black,<br>
					Why you never see bright colors on my back,<br>
					And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone.<br>
					Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.<br>
					I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,<br>
					Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town,<br>
					I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime,<br>
					But is there because he's a victim of the times.<br>
					About the road to happiness through love and charity,<br>
					Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.<br>
					I wear it for the sick and lonely old,<br>
					For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold,<br>
					I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,<br>
					Each week we lose a hundred fine young men.<br><br>
					And, I wear it for the thousands who have died,<br>
					Believen' that the Lord was on their side,<br>
					I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died,<br>
					Believen' that we all were on their side.<br>
					Well, there's things that never will be right I know,<br>
					And things need changin' everywhere you go,<br>
					But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right,<br>
					You'll never see me wear a suit of white.<br>
					Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day,<br>
					And tell the world that everything's Ok,<br>
					But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back,<br>
					'Till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black.</p>
